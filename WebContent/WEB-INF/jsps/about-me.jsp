<br/><b>So what`s your name ? </b><br/>
First of all , I am not Jason Bourne . My Name is Mahtab Alam.
</p>



<p style="align:justify; width: 50%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
<br/><b>What is your Philosophy ?</b><br/>
Its very simple work hard , pray hard.Live freely and help others.
</p>



<p style="align:justify; width: 50%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
<br/><b>Where do you work ?</b><br/>
Currently I am working at <a href="http://www.edureka.co" target="_blank">edureka</a> , its an online training company that offers various  courses like Hadoop , BigData ,Data Science, Programming Languages etc.
My work is to make sure that the quality of our courses stand out from others. 
</p>

<p style="align:justify; width: 50%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
<br/><b>What do you do in leisure time?</b><br/>
Whenever I get some free time usually I go to meet my friends and some time I will catch a random bus to roam around Bangalore.
</p>

<p style="align:justify; width: 50%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
<br/><b>Is there something you are afraid of?</b><br/>
Yes , One of the biggest among them is not making the most out of my life.I do think Life is a great gift by  Almighty and
 we all should understand the value of every single moment.
</p>

<p style="align:justify; width: 50%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
<br/><b>What makes you feel happy?</b><br/>
There are lots of things , sometimes its praying, sometimes its a cup of tea and sometimes its a smile passed by a random guy.
</p>

<p style="align:justify; width: 50%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
<br/><b>Since you are a Muslim tell us about Muslims and Islam ?</b><br/>
Islam is a great religion and unfortunately the most misunderstood one also.Essence of Islam is to do Good and advise the same and stay away from bad.
And I do think nowadays Muslims themselves are far away from Islam and they expect others to understand Islam and Muslims.
I do respect people of all  religions and this is what Islam teaches us.You will always find people who have filled their heart with hatred.
And you will also find people who just help and love everyone regardless of their religion.
</p>

<p style="align:justify; width: 50%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
<br/><b>So Mahtab when you are looking to marry?</b><br/>
Oh..this is tough one.I don`t have any plans right now maybe after couple of years. InshaAllah as Allah wills.But I am surely not afraid of marriage.
</p>

<p style="align:justify; width: 50%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
<br/><b>Thank you Mahtab It was a pleasure talking with you.And good luck for your future.</b><br/>
Thank you very much John and good luck to you also. #Ma`aslamah &#1573;&#1604;&#1609; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1602;&#1575;&#1569;
