<h1 align="center">Oracle Certified Professional Java Programmer</h1><br/><br/>
<div >
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">I written my first exam Oracle Certified Java Professional Programmer 1Z0-851 on  16 March 2013.
I prepared for this exam rigorously since this is the first time I was going to write any Certification Exam. 
I was very much interested in this exam from more than one year. 
What was keeping me away from writing this exam was time , since in college time pursuing a goal was a bit tough.
One day while a friend of mine mentioning about exam I really got motivated to go for this exam.
</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
I read many stories on coderanch of guys who have already cleared this exam and their preparation for the exam.
I planned for this exam , searched through internet whatever that can help me to pass this exam.
Passing this exam requires a serious study , so I planned accordingly.
I purchased Kathy and Bert`s famous book to prepare , I used to study each chapter than I follow the quizzes. Sometimes I feel very bored.
While I was reading the book I didn`t get many concepts .
</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
Many a times the goal that I was aiming seemed very far and I suspected whether I will be able to complete it.
When I got to the end of the book , I felt fifty-fifty .Which is not  the right feeling that you should get before opting a costly exam . 
So I read the book again and again and then only those things that I am not very confident about.
But still that feeling was missing , to write the real exam. 
So I bought another book which was for practicing the questions for the exam. I remember I have to sit for two hours to complete the mock exam.
And I can tell you the first mock exam that I tried I was unable to sit for even 20 minutes.
</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
However I completed this book also , prepared a bunch of notes. But still something was missing  , And I was more restless in my quest of passing this exam.
So I started doing practice exams from Devaka Cooray`s exam simulator. 
And If I remember  , I failed to even read all the questions for the first mock exam.
As the real exam is of two and half hour duration , I have to make a habit of sitting for long time without losing attention
</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
That's when I got to know I still require more study.
And If I remember I failed one after another almost 5 mock exams and with very poor scores.
I started preparing notes about the concepts I was getting wrong.
I started coding more and more. Once I finished all practice exam from exam simulator .
I was in good shape but still I had fear of failing the exam. So how to get rid of this fear .
Even though I had fear of failing the exam but inside I was feeling that I will be able to pass the exam even If I don't score very high.
So I booked my exam in  Pink City Jaipur at one of the Pearson center on Saturday. 
</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
Travelled through Ajmer to Jaipur in early morning. After finishing all the formalities the real exam started. 
I found real exam very easy , If I remember I finished around 40 questions in some 35 minutes. 
So now I was left with only 20 questions to answer with so much time left. 
I answered all the questions, for some of the questions I was not sure of my answer . 
Finished the exam , as exam results are not shown immediately I have to wait for sometime . 
I went to a local cyber cafe and checked my exam result and surprisingly I got 93%.
So the day ended with all kinds of feeling and at the end I was able to do it. 
Still when I think of those days it feels awesome. Not just because I passed the exam but the way I did it.

<h1 align="center">Oracle Database SQL Certified Expert</h1>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
Since I passed my Java Professional Programmer exam , I wanted to do more. 
I was quite much interested in learning SQL. So I decided to take up SQL Expert Exam
 (1Z0-047) which looks to be very exhaustive as it is very detailed exam covering every part of Oracle SQL . 
 I bought the Steve `O Hearn`s SQL Expert Exam Guide which was really great  and I still refer to that book whenever I require.
 This exam was very tough compared to the previous Java Programmer exam . 

</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
To pass this exam you really need to know how SQL works and how to write a query to retrieve what you are looking for. 
I soon realized that this thing is going to take time and it will be better to let it take time rather then pushing it . 
So I landed to my first job while preparing for the exam. It was a Trainer job where my work was to teach Programming Languages
 and make academic projects for students . I selected this Job because I thought this job will give me some free time that 
 I really required. But I was wrong. 
</p>

<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
I finish my job come back and study which is quite a usual routine for most of the software guys.
So I was fed up of studying and just wanted to finish it up quickly. So I booked my exam on April 5 at one of the  
Pearson center in Bangalore. As the exam started I felt exam to be difficult just after 10 minutes , I got the 
feeling that I am in trouble. So the only way I had is to keep answering question one after another , questions 
were very lengthy , almost every question taking more than one minute. When I finished the exam I knew that I might have failed this exam. 
</p>

<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
I went home and checked the result and I passed the exam with 67%. I prepared for this exam for about 1 year ,
 while preparing for it I went off track many times. It was very important at that time,  that I pass this exam as
 I have put many things on it. Many people asked me why you are doing this Trainer Job why I am not working in some big
 companies. The reason was this exam. I loved my first Job and I do think that I did a great job .

<h1 align="center">Oracle Java EE Web Component Developer</h1>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
So this time I started with Java EE Web Component Developer Exam , Since I was teaching Java . 
Many a times I felt the lack of knowledge of Java EE technology.
So I thought of why not study about it and I made my mind that I am going to write this exam as soon as possible. 
This exam was easy as compared to previous two exams that I studied.
</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
I studied for it almost for three months , as I already knew about JSP and Servlet so it was not completely new to me. 
Studying for this exam helped me a lot. And this time I didn`t purchased any book since I already had it.
I used famous Head First book written by Kathy ,Bert and Bryan Basham. 
I also purchased enthuware`s test studio this time to do some mock exams.
 </p>
 <p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
Since this exam gives much importance to API its important that you remember the API very well.
I passed this exam with 87 % , passing this exam have helped me a lot to understand Java EE.
