Kilis, Turkey - On a bustling street in this city near the border with Syria, a tiny boy among other children peddling cigarettes tries to sell chocolate biscuits in a box. "Would you buy one?" he keeps asking, while pulling his loose, dirty trousers up to his thin waist.
Seven-year-old Atman Khalil is the youngest member of his family, having fled its war-torn hometown of Tariq al-Bab, in Aleppo, to take refuge in Turkey. Khalil's father is sick, and the family now depends on the children to provide for them.
</p>

<p style="align:justify; width: 52%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
Forced to work long hours to support their families in Turkey, young Syrian refugees feel robbed of their childhood.Many Syrian refugees do not speak Turkish, making finding a job difficult. They also do not have legal status to work in Turkey, meaning that many end up in the informal labour market.
