Since I passed my Java Professional Programmer exam , I wanted to do more. 
I was quite much interested in learning SQL. So I decided to take up SQL Expert Exam
 (1Z0-047) which looks to be very exhaustive as it is very detailed exam covering every part of Oracle SQL . 
 I bought the Steve `O Hearn`s SQL Expert Exam Guide which was really great  and I still refer to that book whenever I require.
 This exam was very tough compared to the previous Java Programmer exam . 

</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 52%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
To pass this exam you really need to know how SQL works and how to write a query to retrieve what you are looking for. 
I soon realized that this thing is going to take time and it will be better to let it take time rather then pushing it . 
So I landed to my first job while preparing for the exam. It was a Trainer job where my work was to teach Programming Languages
 and make academic projects for students . I selected this Job because I thought this job will give me some free time that 
 I really required. But I was wrong. 
</p>

<p style="align:justify; width: 52%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
I finish my job come back and study which is quite a usual routine for most of the software guys.
So I was fed up of studying and just wanted to finish it up quickly. So I booked my exam on April 5 at one of the  
Pearson center in Bangalore. As the exam started I felt exam to be difficult just after 10 minutes , I got the 
feeling that I am in trouble. So the only way I had is to keep answering question one after another , questions 
were very lengthy , almost every question taking more than one minute. When I finished the exam I knew that I might have failed this exam. 
</p>

<p style="align:justify; width: 52%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
I went home and checked the result and I passed the exam with 67%. I prepared for this exam for about 1 year ,
 while preparing for it I went off track many times. It was very important at that time,  that I pass this exam as
 I have put many things on it. Many people asked me why you are doing this Trainer Job why I am not working in some big
 companies. The reason was this exam. I loved my first Job and I do think that I did a great job .
