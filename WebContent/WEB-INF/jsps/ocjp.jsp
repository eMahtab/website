<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
I written my first exam Oracle Certified Java Professional Programmer 1Z0-851 on  16 March 2013.
I prepared for this exam rigorously since this is the first time I was going to write any Certification Exam. 
I was very much interested in this exam from more than one year. 
What was keeping me away from writing this exam was time , since in college time pursuing a goal was a bit tough.
One day while a friend of mine mentioning about exam I really got motivated to go for this exam.
</p>

<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
I read many stories on coderanch of guys who have already cleared this exam and their preparation for the exam.
I planned for this exam , searched through internet whatever that can help me to pass this exam.
Passing this exam requires a serious study , so I planned accordingly.
I purchased Kathy and Bert`s famous book to prepare , I used to study each chapter than I follow the quizzes. Sometimes I feel very bored.
While I was reading the book I didn`t get many concepts .
</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
Many a times the goal that I was aiming seemed very far and I suspected whether I will be able to complete it.
When I got to the end of the book , I felt fifty-fifty .Which is not  the right feeling that you should get before opting a costly exam . 
So I read the book again and again and then only those things that I am not very confident about.
But still that feeling was missing , to write the real exam. 
So I bought another book which was for practicing the questions for the exam. I remember I have to sit for two hours to complete the mock exam.
And I can tell you the first mock exam that I tried I was unable to sit for even 20 minutes.
</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
However I completed this book also , prepared a bunch of notes. But still something was missing  , And I was more restless in my quest of passing this exam.
So I started doing practice exams from Devaka Cooray`s exam simulator. 
And If I remember  , I failed to even read all the questions for the first mock exam.
As the real exam is of two and half hour duration , I have to make a habit of sitting for long time without losing attention
</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
That's when I got to know I still require more study.
And If I remember I failed one after another almost 5 mock exams and with very poor scores.
I started preparing notes about the concepts I was getting wrong.
I started coding more and more. Once I finished all practice exam from exam simulator .
I was in good shape but still I had fear of failing the exam. So how to get rid of this fear .
Even though I had fear of failing the exam but inside I was feeling that I will be able to pass the exam even If I don't score very high.
So I booked my exam in  Pink City Jaipur at one of the Pearson center on Saturday. 
</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
Travelled through Ajmer to Jaipur in early morning. After finishing all the formalities the real exam started. 
I found real exam very easy , If I remember I finished around 40 questions in some 35 minutes. 
So now I was left with only 20 questions to answer with so much time left. 
I answered all the questions, for some of the questions I was not sure of my answer . 
Finished the exam , as exam results are not shown immediately I have to wait for sometime . 
I went to a local cyber cafe and checked my exam result and surprisingly I got 93%.
So the day ended with all kinds of feeling and at the end I was able to do it. 
Still when I think of those days it feels awesome. Not just because I passed the exam but the way I did it.
