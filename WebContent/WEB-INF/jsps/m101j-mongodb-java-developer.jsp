	<p style="align: justify; width: 52%; margin: 0 auto 1em auto">It
		all started in October when one day I was reading about MongoDB.
		I already had some knowledge of relational databases.
		But MongoDB was something new for me.
		MongoDB is the most popular NOSQL Database among NOSQL Document Based Databases , so I thought let`s give it a try.
		Fortunately I got to know about this M101J course offered by MongoDB University , so I got enrolled in that.
		
		
		</p>
		
		<p style="align: justify; width: 52%; margin: 0 auto 1em auto">
		M101J is a 7 week course where you will be given some assignment after each week class.
		For class you will have access to pre recorded videos , you can download those videos also.
		And you have to submit your assignments before  17:00 UTC of next week  , late submissions are not counted.		
		This course is very well organized , where you will have access to support forum , In case if you are stuck during assignments.
		I must say that I learnt a lot from this course on all the aspects of MongoDB.
		</p>
		
		<p style="align: justify; width: 52%; margin: 0 auto 1em auto">
		So what is covered in this course.Here I am listing the topics of the course<br><br>
		<b>1. Introduction to MongoDB , Maven , Spark , Freemarker</b><br>
		<b>2. CRUD operation in MongoDB</b><br>
		<b>3. Schema Design</b><br>
		
		<b>4. Performance</b><br>
		<b>5. Aggregation Framework</b><br>
		<b>6. Application Engineering</b><br>
		<b>7. Case Studies </b><br><br>
		<b>Final Exam (10 Questions)</b><br>
		</p>
		
		<p style="align: justify; width: 52%; margin: 0 auto 1em auto">
		I passed the exam with 100% grade , which was a bit surprising.As I was not expecting that much.
		But score does not matter , what matters is how much you learnt.You can see your progress report throughout course.
		Below is the snapshot of my progress report.
		</p>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><img height="400" width="900"
					src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/images/m101j-mongodb-java-developer-progress-report.JPG" /></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</div><br>
	
	<p style="align: justify; width: 52%; margin: 0 auto 1em auto">
		To get the course completion certificate you must score at least 65%.
		I am thankful to Andrew Erlichson , Jeff Yemin and entire MongoDB team.
		In case you need some extra  information regarding the course , you can always reach me.
