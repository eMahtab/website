So this time I started with Java EE Web Component Developer Exam , Since I was teaching Java . 
Many a times I felt the lack of knowledge of Java EE technology.
So I thought of why not study about it and I made my mind that I am going to write this exam as soon as possible. 
This exam was easy as compared to previous two exams that I studied.
</p>
<p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
I studied for it almost for three months , as I already knew about JSP and Servlet so it was not completely new to me. 
Studying for this exam helped me a lot. And this time I didn`t purchased any book since I already had it.
I used famous Head First book written by Kathy ,Bert and Bryan Basham. 
I also purchased enthuware`s test studio this time to do some mock exams.
 </p>
 <p style="align:justify; width: 48%;    margin: 0 auto 1em auto ">
Since this exam gives much importance to API its important that you remember the API very well.
I passed this exam with 87% , passing this exam have helped me a lot to understand Java EE.
