Cricket bats are placed at Donnelly Welsh Playing Fields in Macksville, New South Wales, in memory of Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes, who died this week after he was hit in the head by a ball during a match. 
Fans across Australia have paid tribute to the sportsman by leaving cricket bats outside their front doors and using the Twitter hashtag #putoutyourbats.

Who would have thought it will be the last match of his life.
He was preparing to play in the Australia India Test Series , but it was not destined for him.
May Almighty give his family the strength to overcome this lose.
I doubt whether it is possible or not.

Hughes is handed his first cap by Australia for the game against South Africa at the Wanderers in Johannesburg, replacing Matthew Hayden (he is pictured alongside debutants Marcus North and Ben Hilfenhaus).
